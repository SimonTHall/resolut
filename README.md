Resolut Interview Task

Additional tasks to do (if time had been permitting):
1. Add Account creation time
2. Add AccountTransaction creation time
3. Make the domain objects immutable. The testing framework did not allow for this but I can find another JSON-POJO converter that will allow.
4. Add logging
5. Add toString functions
6. Change to use injection framework Guice or something... but not Spring :(
